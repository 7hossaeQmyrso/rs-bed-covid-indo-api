The novel is set in the early decades of the 20th century, when Venezuela was undergoing political and social changes. The country was moving from a rural and feudal society to a modern and urban one, influenced by foreign interests and ideologies. The novel depicts the contrast between the old and the new, the black and the white, the European and the African, through the characters and their interactions. Don Federico represents the decadence of the colonial aristocracy, who have lost their vitality and connection with the land. Natividad represents the resilience and creativity of the Afro-Venezuelan population, who have preserved their ancestral traditions and spirituality.
 
The novel also narrates a forbidden love story between Don Federico and a black woman named MarÃ­a Teresa, who works in his plantation. Their relationship is condemned by both races, who see it as a betrayal of their own. MarÃ­a Teresa flees from Cumboto after giving birth to a son, who is later brought back to Don Federico by Natividad. The son, named Cumboto after the plantation, is a symbol of hope and reconciliation between the two races. He inherits his father's intelligence and his mother's beauty, and he shows a remarkable talent for music. He also faces discrimination and violence from both sides, who reject him for being different.
 
Cumboto is a novel that challenges the stereotypes and prejudices of its time, and offers a vision of a possible harmony between black and white in Venezuela. It is considered one of the most important works of Venezuelan literature, and a precursor of magical realism in Latin America. It has been translated into several languages, including English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese. It is available online as a free PDF download from Archive.org[^1^].
  
The novel is also a reflection of the author's own life and experiences. RamÃ³n DÃ­az SÃ¡nchez was born in 1903 in Caracas, Venezuela, to a wealthy and influential family. He studied law and literature at the Central University of Venezuela, and became a prominent journalist, diplomat, and politician. He was also a passionate advocate of social justice and democracy, and opposed the dictatorship of Juan Vicente GÃ³mez, who ruled Venezuela from 1908 to 1935. DÃ­az SÃ¡nchez was exiled several times for his political views, and lived in various countries, including Spain, France, Mexico, and the United States. He wrote Cumboto during his first exile in Spain, where he was influenced by the Spanish Civil War and the works of Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca and Miguel de Unamuno. He returned to Venezuela in 1941, and continued his literary and political career until his death in 1968.
 
The novel is also a masterpiece of literary style and technique. DÃ­az SÃ¡nchez uses a rich and poetic language, full of metaphors, symbols, and musical rhythms. He combines realistic and fantastic elements, creating a magical atmosphere that contrasts with the harsh reality of the plantation. He also uses multiple perspectives and voices, shifting from third-person narration to first-person monologues and dialogues. He blends Spanish and African languages, cultures, and worldviews, creating a unique and diverse literary expression. He also experiments with time and space, using flashbacks, flash-forwards, dreams, and visions to create a complex and nonlinear narrative structure.
 
Cumboto is a novel that invites the reader to explore the depths of human nature and the possibilities of human coexistence. It is a novel that challenges the reader to question their own prejudices and assumptions about race, class, culture, and identity. It is a novel that celebrates the diversity and richness of Venezuelan society and culture. It is a novel that deserves to be read and appreciated by anyone interested in literature, history, and humanity.
